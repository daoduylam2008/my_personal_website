    "about": "My nam is Lam Dao, I'm from Vietnam and a 12th grade student study abroad in Florida Preparatory Academy. I have a deep passion for Computer Science and plan to major in it when I apply to college. \n\nBeyond academics, I love traveling, tramping and trailing, exploring nature--especially mountainous landscape. Music is also an important part of my life, and I enjoy singing and beatboxing.\n\nI have been programming since I was 12 years old and am proficient in Python, Dart, C++, Swift. Additionally, I enjoy playing chess, and was proud to earn a team-bronze medal with my teammates in 7th grade. \n\nSports are another big interest of mine. I particularly love soccer, but I also enjoy playing volleyball, basketball.",
